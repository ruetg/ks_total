# lem_optimize
For now we need to manually install requirements in requirements.txt using (ideally) mamba or the most recent conda version \

Step 1 is to try the following with conda: \
    conda create --name ks \
    conda install numba \
    conda install -c conda-forge geopandas \
    conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib \
    conda install multiprocess \
    conda install -c conda-forge rasterio \
    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn \
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-lab \
    conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api \
    conda install -c conda-forge rasterio


Data can be generated by following the nz_example.ipynb notebook, although probably for now best to start with the optimization / results plotting

To run the nz_example notebook, you will need to create an EarthEngine account - you will be prompted to create one when running it.  The resulting files should be saved on your google drive.

The  optimisation can be run via the nz_example.ipynb notebook, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For real applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):

Example Dems are pre-loaded into the "example_data/dem" folder

Results can be plotted using postprocess_examples
