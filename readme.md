# lem_optimize
For now we need to manually install requirements in requirements.txt using (ideally) mamba or the most recent conda version

Data can be generated by following the nz_example.ipynb notebook, although probably for now best to start with the optimization

The  optimisation can be run via the montecarlo.py script, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For real applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):

Example Dems are pre-loaded into the "example_data/dem" folder

Results can be plotted using postprocess_examples
