# lem_optimize
For now we need to manually install requirements in requirements.txt using (ideally) mamba or the most recent conda version

Step 1 is to try the following with conda:
    conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
    conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
    conda install multiprocess
    conda install numba
    conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
    conda install -c conda-forge scikit_learn

Data can be generated by following the nz_example.ipynb notebook, although probably for now best to start with the optimization

The  optimisation can be run via the nz_example.ipynb notebook, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For real applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):

Example Dems are pre-loaded into the "example_data/dem" folder

Results can be plotted using postprocess_examples
