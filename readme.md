# lem_optimize
For now we need to manually install requirements in requirements.txt using (ideally) mamba or the most recent conda version \

Step 1 is to try the following with conda: \
    conda create --name ks \
    conda install numba \
    conda install -c conda-forge geopandas \
    conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib \
    conda install multiprocess \
    conda install -c conda-forge rasterio \
    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn \
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab \
    conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api \
    conda install -c conda-forge rasterio


Data can be generated by following the nz_example.ipynb notebook, although probably for now best to start with the optimization / results plotting

To run the nz_example notebook, you will need to create an EarthEngine account - you will be prompted to create one when running it. \

Procedure for EarthEngine acct. creation: \
1) Run the first cell of the notebook - it should open a browser \
2) Sign into your Google account \
3) Create a new GEE project \
4) Choose project name -> select \
5) Generate token \
6) Select account again \
7) "Select what notebook can access" -> Select all
8) Continue
9) Copy the code, enter it back into the notebook


The resulting files should be saved on your google drive.

The  optimisation can be run via the nz_example.ipynb notebook, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For real applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):

Example Dems are pre-loaded into the "example_data/dem" folder

Results can be plotted using postprocess_examples
